---------------------

Pause pipeline until quality gate is computed

The waitForQualityGate step will pause the pipeline until SonarQube analysis is completed and returns quality gate status.

Pre-requisites:

    SonarQube server 6.2+ (need webhook feature)
    Configure a webhook in your SonarQube server pointing to <your Jenkins instance>/sonarqube-webhook/ (info) The trailing slash is mandatory with SonarQube 6.2 and 6.3!

    Use withSonarQubeEnv step in your pipeline (so that SonarQube taskId is correctly attached to the pipeline context).

Example (scripted pipeline):

Wait for Quality Gate under Maven (scripted)
node {
  stage('SCM') {
    git 'https://github.com/foo/bar.git'
  }
  stage('SonarQube analysis') {
    withSonarQubeEnv('My SonarQube Server') {
      sh 'mvn clean package sonar:sonar'
    } // SonarQube taskId is automatically attached to the pipeline context
  }
}
  
// No need to occupy a node
stage("Quality Gate"){
  timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') { // Just in case something goes wrong, pipeline will be killed after a timeout
    def qg = waitForQualityGate() // Reuse taskId previously collected by withSonarQubeEnv
    if (qg.status != 'OK') {
      error "Pipeline aborted due to quality gate failure: ${qg.status}"
    }
  }
}

Jenkins Set Environment Variables

When a Jenkins job executes, it sets some environment variables that you may use in your shell script, batch command, Ant script or Maven POM #1. The following table contains a list of all of these environment variables.

BUILD_NUMBER
	

The current build number, such as "153"

BUILD_ID
	

The current build id, such as "2005-08-22_23-59-59" (YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss, defunct since version 1.597)

BUILD_URL
	

The URL where the results of this build can be found (e.g. http://buildserver/jenkins/job/MyJobName/666/)

NODE_NAME
	

The name of the node the current build is running on. Equals 'master' for master node.

JOB_NAME
	

Name of the project of this build. This is the name you gave your job when you first set it up. It's the third column of the Jenkins Dashboard main page.

BUILD_TAG
	

String of jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}. Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.

JENKINS_URL
	

Set to the URL of the Jenkins master that's running the build. This value is used by Jenkins CLI for example

EXECUTOR_NUMBER
	

The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) that's carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.

JAVA_HOME
	

If your job is configured to use a specific JDK, this variable is set to the JAVA_HOME of the specified JDK. When this variable is set, PATH is also updated to have $JAVA_HOME/bin.

WORKSPACE
	

The absolute path of the workspace.

SVN_REVISION
	

For Subversion-based projects, this variable contains the revision number of the module. If you have more than one module specified, this won't be set.

CVS_BRANCH
	

For CVS-based projects, this variable contains the branch of the module. If CVS is configured to check out the trunk, this environment variable will not be set.

GIT_COMMIT
	

For Git-based projects, this variable contains the Git hash of the commit checked out for the build (like ce9a3c1404e8c91be604088670e93434c4253f03) (all the GIT_* variables require git plugin)    

GIT_URL
	

For Git-based projects, this variable contains the Git url (like git@github.com:user/repo.git or [https://github.com/user/repo.git])

GIT_BRANCH
	

For Git-based projects, this variable contains the Git branch that was checked out for the build (normally origin/master)
