MSBuild Command-Line Reference

MSBuild.exe [Switches] [ProjectFile]  

Arguments
Argument 	Description
ProjectFile 	Builds the targets in the project file that you specify. If you don't specify a project file, MSBuild searches the current working directory for a file name extension that ends in "proj" and uses that file. 
You can also specify a Visual Studio solution file for this argument.

Syntax:              MSBuild.exe [options] [project file]

Description:         Builds the specified targets in the project file. If
                     a project file is not specified, MSBuild searches the
                     current working directory for a file that has a file
                     extension that ends in "proj" and uses that file.

Switches:

  /target:<targets>  Build these targets in this project. Use a semicolon or a
                     comma to separate multiple targets, or specify each
                     target separately. (Short form: /t)
                     Example:
                       /target:Resources;Compile

  /property:<n>=<v>  Set or override these project-level properties. <n> is
                     the property name, and <v> is the property value. Use a
                     semicolon or a comma to separate multiple properties, or
                     specify each property separately. (Short form: /p)
                     Example:
                       /property:WarningLevel=2;OutDir=bin\Debug\

  /maxcpucount[:n]   Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to
                     build with. If the switch is not used, the default
                     value used is 1. If the switch is used without a value
                     MSBuild will use up to the number of processors on the
                     computer. (Short form: /m[:n])

  /toolsversion:<version>
                     The version of the MSBuild Toolset (tasks, targets, etc.)
                     to use during build. This version will override the
                     versions specified by individual projects. (Short form:
                     /tv)
                     Example:
                       /toolsversion:3.5

  /verbosity:<level> Display this amount of information in the event log.
                     The available verbosity levels are: q[uiet], m[inimal],
                     n[ormal], d[etailed], and diag[nostic]. (Short form: /v)
                     Example:
                       /verbosity:quiet

  /consoleloggerparameters:<parameters>
                     Parameters to console logger. (Short form: /clp)
                     The available parameters are:
                        PerformanceSummary--Show time spent in tasks, targets
                            and projects.
                        Summary--Show error and warning summary at the end.
                        NoSummary--Don't show error and warning summary at the
                            end.
                        ErrorsOnly--Show only errors.
                        WarningsOnly--Show only warnings.
                        NoItemAndPropertyList--Don't show list of items and
                            properties at the start of each project build.
                        ShowCommandLine--Show TaskCommandLineEvent messages
                        ShowTimestamp--Display the Timestamp as a prefix to any
                            message.
                        ShowEventId--Show eventId for started events, finished
                            events, and messages
                        ForceNoAlign--Does not align the text to the size of
                            the console buffer
                        DisableConsoleColor--Use the default console colors
                            for all logging messages.
                        DisableMPLogging-- Disable the multiprocessor
                            logging style of output when running in
                            non-multiprocessor mode.
                        EnableMPLogging--Enable the multiprocessor logging
                            style even when running in non-multiprocessor
                            mode. This logging style is on by default.
                        Verbosity--overrides the /verbosity setting for this
                            logger.
                     Example:
                        /consoleloggerparameters:PerformanceSummary;NoSummary;
                                                 Verbosity=minimal

  /noconsolelogger   Disable the default console logger and do not log events
                     to the console. (Short form: /noconlog)

  /fileLogger[n]     Logs the build output to a file. By default
                     the file is in the current directory and named
                     "msbuild[n].log". Events from all nodes are combined into
                     a single log. The location of the file and other
                     parameters for the fileLogger can be specified through
                     the addition of the "/fileLoggerParameters[n]" switch.
                     "n" if present can be a digit from 1-9, allowing up to
                     10 file loggers to be attached. (Short form: /fl[n])

  /fileloggerparameters[n]:<parameters>
                     Provides any extra parameters for file loggers.
                     The presence of this switch implies the
                     corresponding /filelogger[n] switch.
                     "n" if present can be a digit from 1-9.
                     /fileloggerparameters is also used by any distributed
                     file logger, see description of /distributedFileLogger.
                     (Short form: /flp[n])
                     The same parameters listed for the console logger are
                     available. Some additional available parameters are:
                        LogFile--path to the log file into which the
                            build log will be written.
                        Append--determines if the build log will be appended
                            to or overwrite the log file. Setting the
                            switch appends the build log to the log file;
                            Not setting the switch overwrites the
                            contents of an existing log file.
                            The default is not to append to the log file.
                        Encoding--specifies the encoding for the file,
                            for example, UTF-8, Unicode, or ASCII
                     Default verbosity is Detailed.
                     Examples:
                       /fileLoggerParameters:LogFile=MyLog.log;Append;
                                           Verbosity=diagnostic;Encoding=UTF-8

                       /flp:Summary;Verbosity=minimal;LogFile=msbuild.sum
                       /flp1:warningsonly;logfile=msbuild.wrn
                       /flp2:errorsonly;logfile=msbuild.err

  /distributedlogger:<central logger>*<forwarding logger>
                     Use this logger to log events from MSBuild, attaching a
                     different logger instance to each node. To specify
                     multiple loggers, specify each logger separately.
                     (Short form /dl)
                     The <logger> syntax is:
                       [<logger class>,]<logger assembly>[;<logger parameters>]
                     The <logger class> syntax is:
                       [<partial or full namespace>.]<logger class name>
                     The <logger assembly> syntax is:
                       {<assembly name>[,<strong name>] | <assembly file>}
                     The <logger parameters> are optional, and are passed
                     to the logger exactly as you typed them. (Short form: /l)
                     Examples:
                       /dl:XMLLogger,MyLogger,Version=1.0.2,Culture=neutral
                       /dl:MyLogger,C:\My.dll*ForwardingLogger,C:\Logger.dll

  /distributedFileLogger
                     Logs the build output to multiple log files, one log file
                     per MSBuild node. The initial location for these files is
                     the current directory. By default the files are called
                     "MSBuild<nodeid>.log". The location of the files and
                     other parameters for the fileLogger can be specified
                     with the addition of the "/fileLoggerParameters" switch.

                     If a log file name is set through the fileLoggerParameters
                     switch the distributed logger will use the fileName as a
                     template and append the node id to this fileName to
                     create a log file for each node.

  /logger:<logger>   Use this logger to log events from MSBuild. To specify
                     multiple loggers, specify each logger separately.
                     The <logger> syntax is:
                       [<logger class>,]<logger assembly>[;<logger parameters>]
                     The <logger class> syntax is:
                       [<partial or full namespace>.]<logger class name>
                     The <logger assembly> syntax is:
                       {<assembly name>[,<strong name>] | <assembly file>}
                     The <logger parameters> are optional, and are passed
                     to the logger exactly as you typed them. (Short form: /l)
                     Examples:
                       /logger:XMLLogger,MyLogger,Version=1.0.2,Culture=neutral
                       /logger:XMLLogger,C:\Loggers\MyLogger.dll;OutputAsHTML

  /validate          Validate the project against the default schema. (Short
                     form: /val)

  /validate:<schema> Validate the project against the specified schema. (Short
                     form: /val)
                     Example:
                       /validate:MyExtendedBuildSchema.xsd

  /ignoreprojectextensions:<extensions>
                     List of extensions to ignore when determining which
                     project file to build. Use a semicolon or a comma
                     to separate multiple extensions.
                     (Short form: /ignore)
                     Example:
                       /ignoreprojectextensions:.sln

  /nodeReuse:<parameters>
                     Enables or Disables the reuse of MSBuild nodes.
                     The parameters are:
                     True --Nodes will remain after the build completes
                            and will be reused by subsequent builds (default)
                     False--Nodes will not remain after the build completes
                     (Short form: /nr)
                     Example:
                       /nr:true

  /preprocess[:file]
                     Creates a single, aggregated project file by
                     inlining all the files that would be imported during a
                     build, with their boundaries marked. This can be
                     useful for figuring out what files are being imported
                     and from where, and what they will contribute to
                     the build. By default the output is written to
                     the console window. If the path to an output file
                     is provided that will be used instead.
                     (Short form: /pp)
                     Example:
                       /pp:out.txt

  /detailedsummary
                     Shows detailed information at the end of the build
                     about the configurations built and how they were
                     scheduled to nodes.
                     (Short form: /ds)

  @<file>            Insert command-line settings from a text file. To specify
                     multiple response files, specify each response file
                     separately.

                     Any response files named "msbuild.rsp" are automatically
                     consumed from the following locations:
                     (1) the directory of msbuild.exe
                     (2) the directory of the first project or solution built

  /noautoresponse    Do not auto-include any MSBuild.rsp files. (Short form:
                     /noautorsp)

  /nologo            Do not display the startup banner and copyright message.

  /version           Display version information only. (Short form: /ver)

  /help              Display this usage message. (Short form: /? or /h)

Examples:

        MSBuild MyApp.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration=Release
        MSBuild MyApp.csproj /t:Clean
                             /p:Configuration=Debug;TargetFrameworkVersion=v3.5

=================================================
List of Common Properties and Parameters
=================================================

Property or Parameter Name	Description
AdditionalLibPaths	Specifies additional folders in which compilers should look for reference assemblies.
AddModules	Causes the compiler to make all type information from the specified files available to the project you are compiling. This property is equivalent to the /addModules compiler switch.
ALToolPath	The path where AL.exe can be found. This property overrides the current version of AL.exe to enable use of a different version.
ApplicationIcon	The .ico icon file to pass to the compiler for embedding as a Win32 icon. The property is equivalent to the /win32icon compiler switch.
ApplicationManifest	Specifies the path of the file that is used to generate external User Account Control (UAC) manifest information. Applies only to Visual Studio projects targeting Windows Vista.

In most cases, the manifest is embedded. However, if you use Registration Free COM or ClickOnce deployment, then the manifest can be an external file that is installed together with your application assemblies. For more information, see the NoWin32Manifest property in this topic.
AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile	Specifies the file that's used to sign the assembly (.snk or .pfx) and that's passed to the ResolveKeySource Task to generate the actual key that's used to sign the assembly.
AssemblySearchPaths	A list of locations to search during build-time reference assembly resolution. The order in which paths appear in this list is meaningful because paths listed earlier takes precedence over later entries.
AssemblyName	The name of the final output assembly after the project is built.
BaseAddress	Specifies the base address of the main output assembly. This property is equivalent to the /baseaddress compiler switch.
BaseOutputPath	Specifies the base path for the output file. If it is set, MSBuild will use OutputPath = $(BaseOutputPath)\$(Configuration)\. Example syntax: <BaseOutputPath>c:\xyz\bin\</BaseOutputPath>
BaseIntermediateOutputPath	The top-level folder where all configuration-specific intermediate output folders are created. The default value is obj\. The following code is an example: <BaseIntermediateOutputPath>c:\xyz\obj\</BaseIntermediateOutputPath>
BuildInParallel	A boolean value that indicates whether project references are built or cleaned in parallel when Multi-Proc MSBuild is used. The default value is true, which means that projects will be built in parallel if the system has multiple cores or processors.
BuildProjectReferences	A boolean value that indicates whether project references are built by MSBuild. Set false if you are building your project in the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), true if otherwise.
CleanFile	The name of the file that will be used as the "clean cache." The clean cache is a list of generated files to be deleted during the cleaning operation. The file is put in the intermediate output path by the build process.

This property specifies only file names that do not have path information.
CodePage	Specifies the code page to use for all source-code files in the compilation. This property is equivalent to the /codepage compiler switch.
CompilerResponseFile	An optional response file that can be passed to the compiler tasks.
Configuration	The configuration that you are building, either "Debug" or "Release."
CscToolPath	The path of csc.exe, the Visual C# compiler.
CustomBeforeMicrosoftCommonTargets	The name of a project file or targets file that is to be imported automatically before the common targets import.
DebugSymbols	A boolean value that indicates whether symbols are generated by the build.

Setting /p:DebugSymbols=false on the command line disables generation of program database (.pdb) symbol files.
DefineConstants	Defines conditional compiler constants. Symbol/value pairs are separated by semicolons and are specified by using the following syntax:

 symbol1 = value1 ; symbol2 = value2

The property is equivalent to the /define compiler switch.
DefineDebug	A boolean value that indicates whether you want the DEBUG constant defined.
DefineTrace	A boolean value that indicates whether you want the TRACE constant defined.
DebugType	Defines the level of debug information that you want generated. Valid values are "full," "pdbonly," and "none."
DelaySign	A boolean value that indicates whether you want to delay-sign the assembly rather than full-sign it.
DisabledWarnings	Suppresses the specified warnings. Only the numeric part of the warning identifier must be specified. Multiple warnings are separated by semicolons. This parameter corresponds to the /nowarn switch of the vbc.exe compiler.
DisableFastUpToDateCheck	A boolean value that applies to Visual Studio only. The Visual Studio build manager uses a process called FastUpToDateCheck to determine whether a project must be rebuilt to be up to date. This process is faster than using MSBuild to determine this. Setting the DisableFastUpToDateCheck property to true lets you bypass the Visual Studio build manager and force it to use MSBuild to determine whether the project is up to date.
DocumentationFile	The name of the file that is generated as the XML documentation file. This name includes only the file name and has no path information.
ErrorReport	Specifies how the compiler task should report internal compiler errors. Valid values are "prompt," "send," or "none." This property is equivalent to the /errorreport compiler switch.
ExcludeDeploymentUrl	The GenerateDeploymentManifest Task adds a deploymentProvider tag to the deployment manifest if the project file includes any of the following elements:

- UpdateUrl
- InstallUrl
- PublishUrl

Using ExcludeDeploymentUrl, however, you can prevent the deploymentProvider tag from being added to the deployment manifest even if any of the above URLs are specified. To do this, add the following property to your project file:

 <ExcludeDeploymentUrl>true</ExcludeDeploymentUrl> Note: ExcludeDeploymentUrl is not exposed in the Visual Studio IDE and can be set only by manually editing the project file. Setting this property does not affect publishing within Visual Studio; that is, the deploymentProvider tag will still be added to the URL specified by PublishUrl.
FileAlignment	Specifies, in bytes, where to align the sections of the output file. Valid values are 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192. This property is equivalent to the /filealignment compiler switch.
FrameworkPathOverride	Specifies the location of mscorlib.dll and microsoft.visualbasic.dll. This parameter is equivalent to the /sdkpath switch of the vbc.exe compiler.
GenerateDocumentation	A boolean parameter that indicates whether documentation is generated by the build. If true, the build generates documentation information and puts it in an .xml file together with the name of the executable file or library that the build task created.
IntermediateOutputPath	The full intermediate output path as derived from BaseIntermediateOutputPath, if no path is specified. For example, \obj\debug\. If this property is overridden, then setting BaseIntermediateOutputPath has no effect.
KeyContainerName	The name of the strong-name key container.
KeyOriginatorFile	The name of the strong-name key file.
NoWin32Manifest	Determines whether the compiler generates the default Win32 manifest into the output assembly. The default value of false means that the default Win32 manifest is generated for all applications. This property is equivalent to the /nowin32manifest compiler switch of vbc.exe.
ModuleAssemblyName	The name of the assembly that the compiled module is to be incorporated into. The property is equivalent to the /moduleassemblyname compiler switch.
NoLogo	A boolean value that indicates whether you want compiler logo to be turned off. This property is equivalent to the /nologo compiler switch.
NoStdLib	A boolean value that indicates whether to avoid referencing the standard library (mscorlib.dll). The default value is false.
NoVBRuntimeReference	A boolean value that indicates whether the Visual Basic runtime (Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll) should be included as a reference in the project.
NoWin32Manifest	A boolean value that indicates whether User Account Control (UAC) manifest information will be embedded in the application's executable. Applies only to Visual Studio projects targeting Windows Vista. In projects deployed using ClickOnce and Registration-Free COM, this element is ignored. False (the default value) specifies that User Account Control (UAC) manifest information be embedded in the application's executable. True specifies that UAC manifest information not be embedded.

This property applies only to Visual Studio projects targeting Windows Vista. In projects deployed using ClickOnce and Registration-Free COM, this property is ignored.

You should add NoWin32Manifest only if you do not want Visual Studio to embed any manifest information in the application's executable; this process is called virtualization. To use virtualization, set <ApplicationManifest> in conjunction with <NoWin32Manifest> as follows:

- For Visual Basic projects, remove the <ApplicationManifest> node. (In Visual Basic projects, <NoWin32Manifest> is ignored when an <ApplicationManifest> node exists.)
- For Visual C# projects, set <ApplicationManifest> to False and <NoWin32Manifest> to True. (In Visual C# projects, <ApplicationManifest> overrides <NoWin32Manifest>.)
Optimize	A boolean value that when set to true, enables compiler optimizations. This property is equivalent to the /optimize compiler switch.
OptionCompare	Specifies how string comparisons are made. Valid values are "binary" or "text." This property is equivalent to the /optioncompare compiler switch of vbc.exe.
OptionExplicit	A boolean value that when set to true, requires explicit declaration of variables in the source code. This property is equivalent to the /optionexplicit compiler switch.
OptionInfer	A boolean value that when set to true, enables type inference of variables. This property is equivalent to the /optioninfer compiler switch.
OptionStrict	A boolean value that when set to true, causes the build task to enforce strict type semantics to restrict implicit type conversions. This property is equivalent to the /optionstrict switch of the vbc.exe compiler.
OutputPath	Specifies the path to the output directory, relative to the project directory, for example, "bin\Debug".
OutputType	Specifies the file format of the output file. This parameter can have one of the following values:

- Library. Creates a code library. (Default value.)
- Exe. Creates a console application.
- Module. Creates a module.
- Winexe. Creates a Windows-based program.

This property is equivalent to the /target switch of the vbc.exe compiler.
OverwriteReadOnlyFiles	A boolean value that indicates whether you want to enable the build to overwrite read-only files or trigger an error.
PdbFile	The file name of the .pdb file that you are emitting. This property is equivalent to the /pdb switch of the csc.exe compiler.
Platform	The operating system you are building for. Valid values are "Any CPU", "x86", and "x64".
RemoveIntegerChecks	A boolean value that indicates whether to disable integer overflow error checks. The default value is false. This property is equivalent to the /removeintchecks switch of the vbc.exe compiler.
SGenUseProxyTypes	A boolean value that indicates whether proxy types should be generated by SGen.exe.

The SGen target uses this property to set the UseProxyTypes flag. This property defaults to true, and there is no UI to change this. To generate the serialization assembly for non-webservice types, add this property to the project file and set it to false before importing the Microsoft.Common.Targets or the C#/VB.targets.
SGenToolPath	An optional tool path that indicates where to obtain SGen.exe when the current version of SGen.exe is overridden.
StartupObject	Specifies the class or module that contains the Main method or Sub Main procedure. This property is equivalent to the /main compiler switch.
ProcessorArchitecture	The processor architecture that is used when assembly references are resolved. Valid values are "msil," "x86," "amd64," or "ia64."
RootNamespace	The root namespace to use when you name an embedded resource. This namespace is part of the embedded resource manifest name.
Satellite_AlgorithmId	The ID of the AL.exe hashing algorithm to use when satellite assemblies are created.
Satellite_BaseAddress	The base address to use when culture-specific satellite assemblies are built by using the CreateSatelliteAssemblies target.
Satellite_CompanyName	The company name to pass into AL.exe during satellite assembly generation.
Satellite_Configuration	The configuration name to pass into AL.exe during satellite assembly generation.
Satellite_Description	The description text to pass into AL.exe during satellite assembly generation.
Satellite_EvidenceFile	Embeds the specified file in the satellite assembly that has the resource name "Security.Evidence."
Satellite_FileVersion	Specifies a string for the File Version field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_Flags	Specifies a value for the Flags field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_GenerateFullPaths	Causes the build task to use absolute paths for any files reported in an error message.
Satellite_LinkResource	Links the specified resource files to a satellite assembly.
Satellite_MainEntryPoint	Specifies the fully-qualified name (that is, class.method) of the method to use as an entry point when a module is converted to an executable file during satellite assembly generation.
Satellite_ProductName	Specifies a string for the Product field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_ProductVersion	Specifies a string for the ProductVersion field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_TargetType	Specifies the file format of the satellite assembly output file as "library," "exe," or "win." The default value is "library."
Satellite_Title	Specifies a string for the Title field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_Trademark	Specifies a string for the Trademark field in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_Version	Specifies the version information for the satellite assembly.
Satellite_Win32Icon	Inserts an .ico icon file in the satellite assembly.
Satellite_Win32Resource	Inserts a Win32 resource (.res file) into the satellite assembly.
SubsystemVersion	Specifies the minimum version of the subsystem that the generated executable file can use. This property is equivalent to the /subsystemversion compiler switch. For information about the default value of this property, see /subsystemversion (Visual Basic) or /subsystemversion (C# Compiler Options).
TargetCompactFramework	The version of the .NET Compact Framework that is required to run the application that you are building. Specifying this lets you reference certain framework assemblies that you may not be able to reference otherwise.
TargetFrameworkVersion	The version of the .NET Framework that is required to run the application that you are building. Specifying this lets you reference certain framework assemblies that you may not be able to reference otherwise.
TreatWarningsAsErrors	A boolean parameter that, if true, causes all warnings to be treated as errors. This parameter is equivalent to the /nowarn compiler switch.
UseHostCompilerIfAvailable	A boolean parameter that, if true, causes the build task to use the in-process compiler object, if it is available. This parameter is used only by Visual Studio.
Utf8Output	A boolean parameter that, if true, logs compiler output by using UTF-8 encoding. This parameter is equivalent to the /utf8Output compiler switch.
VbcToolPath	An optional path that indicates another location for vbc.exe when the current version of vbc.exe is overridden.
VbcVerbosity	Specifies the verbosity of the Visual Basic compiler’s output. Valid values are "Quiet," "Normal" (the default value), or "Verbose."
VisualStudioVersion	Specifies the version of Visual Studio under which this project should be considered to be running. If this property isn't specified, MSBuild sets it to a reasonable default value.

This property is used in several project types to specify the set of targets that are used for the build. If ToolsVersion is set to 4.0 or higher for a project, VisualStudioVersion is used to specify which sub-toolset to use. For more information, see Toolset (ToolsVersion).
WarningsAsErrors	Specifies a list of warnings to treat as errors. This parameter is equivalent to the /warnaserror compiler switch.
WarningsNotAsErrors	Specifies a list of warnings that are not treated as errors. This parameter is equivalent to the /warnaserror compiler switch.
Win32Manifest	The name of the manifest file that should be embedded in the final assembly. This parameter is equivalent to the /win32Manifest compiler switch.

MSBuild: a simple way to find out all properties and their values while building a csproj file


A very simple way to do this — just build your project with verbosity “diagnostic” for current logger. Obviously it’s better to use fileLogger.
How to do this:

MSBuild.exe MyProj.csproj ^
            /filelogger /fileLoggerParameters:Verbosity=diag
			
Then at the bottom of result log file (which name will be msbuild.log by default) you’ll find all properties with their values.
